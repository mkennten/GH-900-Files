## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Avoid code duplication

### JavaScript/TypeScript Style

- Use ES6+ features
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Use template literals for string concatenation
- Use arrow functions appropriately
- Use async/await instead of callbacks
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Example

```javascript
/**
 * Fetches user data from the API
 * @param {string} userId - The user ID
 * @returns {Promise<User>} The user object
 */
async function fetchUser(userId) {
  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/users/${userId}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```
